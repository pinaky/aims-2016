This file contains tests for classes and free functions (such as those in the 'utilities' namespace).

All source files have a common header: test_header.h

The entry point for the executable is tests.cpp.

Ideally, the 'tests' executable should run with no errors. It may output data files that could be 
read by Python for plots.
